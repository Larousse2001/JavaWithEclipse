# Java University Practice

This repository contains a collection of Java files that were practiced during my university studies to enhance my Java programming skills. These files cover various topics and concepts in Java programming and serve as examples and exercises for learning and practicing Java.

## Table of Contents

- **[Algorithms](/algorithms)**: Contains Java implementations of various algorithms, such as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graph algorithms.
- **[Data Structures](/data-structures)**: Includes Java implementations of fundamental data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.
- **[Object-Oriented Programming](/oop)**: Provides Java code examples that demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **[GUI Applications](/gui-applications)**: Contains Java programs that utilize graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using frameworks like Swing or JavaFX.
- **[File Handling](/file-handling)**: Includes Java programs that demonstrate file handling operations, such as reading from and writing to files, file manipulation, and file I/O.
- **[Multithreading](/multithreading)**: Provides Java code examples that showcase multithreading concepts, including thread creation, synchronization, and communication between threads.
- **[Database Connectivity](/database-connectivity)**: Contains Java programs that illustrate database connectivity using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with relational databases.
- **[Networking](/networking)**: Includes Java programs that demonstrate network programming concepts, such as socket programming, client-server communication, and HTTP requests.
- **[JavaFX Applications](/javafx-applications)**: Provides JavaFX applications with rich user interfaces and functionality using the JavaFX framework.

Feel free to explore the different directories in this repository to access and review the Java files. Each directory contains its own README file that provides more information about the specific topic or concept covered.
